# ICTSBA-Krita-eLearn
Originally 2021 HKDSE ICT SBA, themed as e-learn platform on software Krita

This project was originally a part of the 2021 HKDSE examination SBA (School-based Assessment),\
while unluckily, CVOID-19 has damaged Hong Kong SAR in different areas include our education time\
And so, Hong Kong Education Bureau has decided to cancel most of the elective's SBA project\
I feel extremely sad and completely can't accept the decide from them,\
As ICT is always a subject to proof ur skill with computers, and not with stupid paper tests.\
Sadly im not powerful enough to change the result from government,\
Therefore I decided to open source my project.\
At here i strongly condemn how stupid and suck is our Education Bureau\
and strongly condemn the draggle of our education environment\
We can learn nothing, is nothing from our ICT syllabus.

##### Hope that one day i will be powerful enough to change all of this shits.
